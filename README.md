This is a script to scrape through TheSite for search results for booking flight via points. An auth.json file has to be created with username, password and url for this script to work.
For email support, an emailConfig.json will be required to be populated. The password in this should be a google app password. This can be set by first enabling two factor authentication, and then going to the same page and creating an app password.

This is a PyCharm project.
